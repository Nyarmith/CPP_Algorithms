# Focal Concepts of Modern C++
- Move-semantics
    - Based on distinguishing rvalues & lvalues
    - rvalues indicate objects eligible for move operations
    - lvalues don't (generally)
- rvalue := temporary objects returned from functions
- lvalue := objects you can refer to by name, ptr or lvalue-reference

- && = rvalue reference
- move construction/assignment != cop construction/assignment
