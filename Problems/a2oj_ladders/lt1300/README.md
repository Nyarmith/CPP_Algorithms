Some nice io forms for problems 1-5

Problem 6 is neat but could be done probably mega-elegantly(and in general for directional logic branching)

Problem 7 could be sped up by starting the [de]capitalization process as soon as we have accumulated enough votes to guarantee a majority (say we're at character n+1 when this happens), then going back to the first n characters that we were tallying.

Problem 12 has some cool bitset operations w/ a string constructor!!

Problem 30 has a pretty cool index-sort mapping that I should be able to implement myself(also record separately maybe in utility algorithm section)

Problem 32 could be sped-up via more modular trix.

Problem 33 is pretty novel, but could be done nicer with maps/sets

Problem 37 has a cool macro PRIu64 from \<cinttypes\> I didn't know about before for reading uint64\_t types

Problem 40 has a simple solution but a bit of thought to get there.

Problem 43 is trivial, but demonstated nice use of reverse iterator+auto

Problem 49 let me use c++11 regex for like the second time

Problem 61 is like two separate weaker problems combines in one, but I actually had to memoize!!

62 and 63 are hard, which makes them good.


Problem 8 was mega-trivial but my solution is a bit clever/nice

Problem 55 permanently running on test 4.

Problem 51 is important for hammering in the equivalence of two basic concepts.
