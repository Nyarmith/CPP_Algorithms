Standouts from this collection... <br />

Some nice io forms for problems 1-5

Problem 6 is neat but could be done probably mega-elegantly(and in general for directional logic branching)

Problem 7 could be sped up by starting the [de]capitalization process as soon as we have accumulated enough votes to guarantee a majority (say we're at character n+1 when this happens), then going back to the first n characters that we were tallying.

Problem 12 has some cool bitset operations w/ a string constructor!!

The improv DS in 24 is a good type to follow and could be generalized for way more contest probs

Problem 30 has a pretty cool index-sort mapping that I should be able to implement myself(also record separately maybe in utility algorithm section)

Problem 32 could be sped-up via more modular trix.

Problem 33 is pretty novel, but could be done nicer with maps/sets

Problem 37 has a cool macro PRIu64 from \<cinttypes\> I didn't know about before for reading uint64\_t types

Problem 40 has a simple solution but a bit of thought to get there.

Problem 43 is trivial, but demonstated nice use of reverse iterator+auto

Problem 49 let me use c++11 regex for like the second time

Problem 56 has cool use of priority queue with pair type

Problem 61 is like two separate weaker problems combines in one, but I actually had to memoize!!

62 and 63 are hard, which makes them good.

Problem 8 was mega-trivial but my solution is a bit clever/nice

Problem 55 permanently running on test 4.

Problem 51 is important for hammering in the equivalence of two basic concepts.

Problem 55 is very open-ended for mega-clever soltuions

I feel like I should do 71 in a more elegant way.

Problems 54 and 74 demonstrate cool use of iterators.

Problem 76 has some min_element and max_element stuff.

Problem 79 demonstrates a creative method of reading a digit at a time.

For problem 80(and presumably other similar problems), you have to add
```
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
```
at the beginning to read/write from a file instead of normal stdin/out streams

Incomplete problems: 86, 82, 89
