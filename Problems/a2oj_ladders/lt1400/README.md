Since there's some overlap, this will only include the problems not in lt1300.

Problem 77 was trickkyyyy, but good to reflect on. Bug-hunt was torturous.

Problem 78 incomplete.

Fun Fact: 90% of time-wastes is due to poor reading comprehension

Soln for 83 should not have passed

I liked num 85's callback

I'm vvvvvv. happy about the entire process involved in solving prob. 86
