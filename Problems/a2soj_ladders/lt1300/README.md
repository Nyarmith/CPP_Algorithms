Some nice io forms for problems 1-5

Problem 6 is neat but could be done probably mega-elegantly(and in general for directional logic branching)

Problem 7 could be sped up by starting the [de]capitalization process as soon as we have accumulated enough votes to guarantee a majority (say we're at character n+1 when this happens), then going back to the first n characters that we were tallying.

Problem 30 has a pretty cool index-sort mapping that I should be able to implement myself(also record separately maybe in utility algorithm section)

Problem 32 could be sped-up via more modular trix.

Problem 37 has a cool macro PRIu64 from \<cinttypes\> I didn't know about before for reading uint64\_t types
